1. Using proper pseudo-code, describe the following primitive algorithms:

Making coffee;

INIT coffeeScoops equals a number
INIT cupsOfWater equals a number

FUNCTION makeCoffee
    IF coffeeScoops equals exactly cupsOfWater THEN
        Make coffee
    ELSE IF coffeeScoops does not equal exactly cupsOfWater THEN
        IF coffeeScoops is greater than cupsOfWater THEN
            SET coffeeScoops to equal cupsOfWater
            Make coffee
        ELSE
            SET cupsOfWater to equal coffeeScoops
            Make coffee
        END IF
    END IF
END FUNCTION


Washing dishes;

INIT isDirty SET TO true

FUNCTION cleanDishes 
  IF isDirty equals true THEN
    Log Cleaning dishes.
  ELSE
    LOG Dishes are clean.
END FUNCTION


A choice of your own.
