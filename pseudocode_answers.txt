Programmers use pseudocode to develop algorithms. It is easy to read, and helps in the brainstorming process.

2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen?

Nothing would happen if you ran pseudocode on your computer since it is not a programming language, but an informal syntax to aid in building programs.
